# DFU_DIALNet: A Novel Approach for Diabetic Foot Ulcer Detection

This project focuses on using machine learning and deep learning to detect diabetic foot ulcers (DFU). The novel DFU_DIALNet approach achieved an accuracy of 99.33%, and the model decisions are interpreted using LIME and Grad-CAM.

## Features:
- **High Accuracy**: DFU_DIALNet achieves 99.33% accuracy.
- **Interpretability**: LIME and Grad-CAM are used to explain the model's decisions.
- **Web Application**: A complete web app to predict foot ulcers.

## Demo
Live Demo: [DFU Prediction App](https://footulcer-bd.onrender.com)

## Technologies Used:
- **Deep Learning Models**: DFU_DIALNet
- **Interpretability Tools**: LIME, Grad-CAM
- **Web Hosting**: Render
